# Waze-Project-EDA
Your team is still in the early stages of their user churn project. So far, you’ve completed a project proposal and used Python to inspect and organize Waze’s user data.

You check your inbox and notice a new message from Chidi Ga, your team’s Senior Data Analyst. Chidi is pleased with the work you have already completed and requests your assistance with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and further data visualization. Harriet Hadzic, Waze's Director of Data Analysis, will want to review a Python notebook that shows your data exploration and visualization.

A notebook was structured and prepared to help you in this project. Please complete the following questions and prepare an executive summary.

#### Course 3 End-of-course project: Exploratory data analysis
In this activity, you will examine data provided and prepare it for analysis.

**The purpose** of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a provided dataset.

**The goal** is to continue the examination of the data that you began in the previous Course, adding relevant visualizations that help communicate the story that the data tells.

This activity has 4 parts:

**Part 1**: Imports, links, and loading

**Part 2**: Data Exploration

* Data cleaning
**Part 3**: Building visualizations

**Part 4**: Evaluating and sharing results



Follow the instructions and answer the question below to complete the activity. Then, you will complete an executive summary using the questions listed on the PACE Strategy Document .

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.
